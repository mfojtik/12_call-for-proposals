# Sinatra Rabbit in Deltacloud API

This talk is about how we use the Rabbit DSL Sinatra extension to produce the
Deltacloud REST API. Rabbit is a minimal DSL that helps us generate the
Sinatra::Base modules with all different cloud abstraction collections
Deltacloud API supports. It has many cool features, like automatic parameter
validation, routes generation, capability checks, etc.  The talk will be a
walkthrough on why we created this DSL and how we use it to make Deltacloud
API better.

break patterns like MVC.
I work for Red Hat on Apache Deltacloud project, so I spend most of my time
